# Balduina Color Scheme for Vim

Balduina is a dark color scheme for Vim, based on the original
industrial scheme but using less 8-bittish colours like cyan and magenta.
Also grey line numbering has been added.

The GUI version has not yet been adjusted.

## Installation (simple)

Copy the file on your .vim/colors folder and add to your .vimrc:
```
colo balduina
```

Or in case you use a plug-in manager like Plug:
```
git clone git://github.com/okoeth/balduina.git ~/.vim/plugged/balduina
```

Then add to your .vimrc between Plug's begin/end directives:
```
...
Plug 'okoeth/balduina'
...
```
